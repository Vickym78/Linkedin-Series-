# Working with Files and Exception Handling in ML Journey

## Overview

In the field of Machine Learning (ML), handling files and exceptions is essential for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. This README provides an overview of the topics covered related to working with files and exception handling in the ML journey.

## Topics Covered

1. File I/O Operations
   - Reading and writing data from/to files
   - Handling file formats
   - Preprocessing data from files for ML tasks

2. Exception Handling
   - Understanding common exceptions in ML workflows
   - Handling exceptions gracefully to prevent crashes
   - Strategies for error logging and debugging

## File I/O Operations

File input/output (I/O) operations are crucial in ML for loading datasets, saving trained models, and storing intermediate results. Understanding how to read from and write to files efficiently is essential for building robust ML pipelines.

## Exception Handling

Exception handling plays a vital role in ML workflows to deal with unexpected errors or issues during data processing, model training, or inference. By implementing robust exception handling mechanisms, ML practitioners can ensure the reliability and stability of their systems.

## Usage

This README serves as a guide for understanding and implementing file handling and exception handling techniques in the context of ML projects. It provides insights into best practices, common pitfalls, and strategies for effective error handling in ML workflows.
